# Yelp-Hygience-California
Initially by my professor from UC Irvine, this is a project following step-by-step approach to analyzing restaurant data from Yelp

1. What questions need to be answered. In this case: Hygience issue
2. What types of data available
3. Choose Attributes and Parameters to research
4. Tools pick. In this case: Python - BeautifulSoup, Request module
5. Model the database
6. Design data pipeline
7. Extract data from Yelp
